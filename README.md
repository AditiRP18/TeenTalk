TeenTalk aims to solve the problems of early mental-gealth problems in the present day's teenagers. It is quite common for a teenager today to face bullying, harassment in school or in public or even on digital platforms. Due to these situations, teenagers often withdraw themselves from the society and refuse to take on any external help, i.e, going to a therapist. Since online chatting platforms have risen to great success in the past years, TeenTalk will be an excellent alternative for teenagers to vent out their problems and their thoughts from the comfort of their home and in a safe and protected space. Mnetal-health organizations can use this service to register their therapists and talk to teenagers through the chat platform and give them helpful insights which will guide them to be  stronger version s of themselves. I hope through this service no child ever feels alone in their own home.
